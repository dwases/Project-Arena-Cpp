All the files in this repository make for a personal C++ project of mine(github.com/dwases).
The entire coding functionality has been created using Borland C++ builder. The graphical assets have either been downloaded from stock or drawn in Microsoft Paint.
To run the file, use the Project1.exe file.
To edit the project use the Project1.bpr file. To do so however, Borland C++ builder is needed.
In case one wanted to learn the licensing of the files in this project, please refer to the LICENSE.txt file.
With all said and done, the creator considers the project to be finishes and as of writing this document does not plan to return to its development.
